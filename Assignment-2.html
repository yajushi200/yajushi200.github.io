    <p><br><b>Introduction-</b>For millennia, humans have transformed the world's landscape with the expansion of
        agricultural land.
        In the process, we have lost one-third of the planet's forests, leading to a severe cost to biodiversity.
        Habitat loss has been, and continues to be, one of the biggest threats to wildlife.
        One way to protect habitats, ecosystems and vulnerable species is to set aside <b>protected areas or
            conservation parks.</b>.
        These are designated zones with stricter limitations on agricultural or infrastructure expansion activities, as
        well as enhanced surveillance of human encroachment. </p>
    <p><br><b>Importance-</b>Protected areas are important tools for the conservation of biological
        diversity and are cornerstones of sustainable development strategies.
        Aside from their environmental benefits, they can also generate significant economic resources.Currently about
        11.6%
        of the Earth's terrestrial surface, protected areas harbor great biological richness and are a major source of
        material and non-material
        wealth. They represent important stocks of natural, cultural and social capital, supporting the livelihood
        and wellbeing of many.</p>
